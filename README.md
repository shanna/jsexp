## Description.

JSON to S-expression.

A quick Go hack to convert any JSON into an S-Expression. Really you'd want to
transform nicer looking JSON converting names to positional atoms but this is
just to get started. Perhaps something could be done with struct tags for maps.

## Installation

### Dependencies

* Go >= 1.0

### Install

```
go get bitbucket.org/shanehanna/jsexp
```

## Usage

## TODO

* Take an `interface{}` the same way the json lib does.
* [Canonical S-expression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_S-expressions) output.

## Contributing

Go nuts! I do not care if you write tests or comment code. If you write
something neat just send a pull request, tweet, email or yell it at me line by
line in person. I will do whatever extra work is required.
